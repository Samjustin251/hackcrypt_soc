# HackCrypt SOC

# Intelligent Security Operations Monitoring & Incident Response Platform

HackCrypt SOC is a simplified yet effective Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation platform designed to monitor, analyze, and respond to suspicious or malicious activities.

This project demonstrates core SOC concepts including log monitoring, threat detection, alert prioritization, and structured incident handling.

# Project Overview

HackCrypt SOC aims to:

- Collect and monitor security-related events
- Simulate intrusion detection logic
- Prioritize alerts based on severity
- Provide structured incident analysis workflow
- Demonstrate basic cybersecurity monitoring concepts

This project is built as a frontend-driven SOC simulation using modern web technologies.

# Key Features

- Security event visualization
- Alert severity classification
- Honeypot strategy simulation (see `HONEYPOT_PLAN.md`)
- Implementation planning documentation
- AI prompt integration planning (`GPT_PROMPT.md`)
- Structured SOC workflow
